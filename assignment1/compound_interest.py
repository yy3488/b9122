def calculate_interest(balance, rate, transactions):
    """
    Calculate the compound interest paid monthly on the balance of
    a bank account.

    Args:
      balance: Current balance of the account at the start of the calculation.
      rate: Annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
      transactions: A list of tuples representing transactions (day, amount).
          Positive amounts are deposits, negative are withdrawals.

    Returns:
      The interest rate to be paid at the end of the month.

    Note: Each doc-test has a comment at the start describing the case.

# Review of generative AI uses and code similarity

If you received an email about your submissions being flagged for possible use of generative AI or similarity to another student, this guide provides some clarity about the process.

Please bear in mind that receiving the email does not mean you did anything wrong. I take academic integrity very seriously, so if I have any doubt about your submission, I will invite you to a meeting to provide a rationale. During this process, you will have an opportunity to explain your actions to myself and perhaps to the Center for Student Success and Intervention (CSSI). In most cases, it will be a routine check due to some unlucky coincidence of two students solving the problem with the same non-trivial logic. If you did nothing wrong, please rest assured that you will not bear any negative consequences. In both cases, you can count on me to always do the right thing.

This is the process:

1. I will ask you to schedule a one-to-one meeting with me via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mm3509-columbia/meeting-with-miguel);

1. I will show you the code that caused suspicion;

1. I will give you an opportunity to explain the situation, if you want to;

1. I will ask you to write the same code from scratch ("live coding"), so I can make an assessment.

Once the internal process has finished I will communicate with you what the next steps are. I will communicate the result by email.

I may offer an arrangement, such as a penalty on your grade. If you accept, and assuming that my review with the other student with similar code points in the same direction, this arrangement will close the matter. You will receive a confirmation email.

If you don't accept, or if I have a strong suspicion of academic dishonesty, I will submit a report to the Student Conduct in CSSI. You will have an opportunity to explain your situation to the student conduct team. They are an impartial team and will explain their process to you should they receive report.

I hope that this guide provides clarity on this process. Please contact me if you have any questions.
